    "Use the layer toggles to view different types of monitoring sites (schools, homes, parks, offices) and explore how air pollution intersects with asthma rates in different census tracts. "
    "The **colored markers** represent PM2.5 pollution levels for 2025: green (low), orange (moderate), and red (high). Census tract outlines and asthma prevalence choropleths provide additional insight into how air quality may affect local residentsâ€™ health. "
    "You can also search for specific census tracts using their GEOID to quickly navigate the map."
